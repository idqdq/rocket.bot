# NetOp Bot for rocket.chat

the bot is intended to help in a system network operations.  
the very first function that has been released is **acl**.  
**acl** checks if a given ip packet can pass throuth  the network with network policies being applied. 

That is how it looks in an action:

the more detailed view:  
![img2](docs/rocket.bot.check.acl.fragment.png)

**acl** uses the **batfish** under the hood.

----

## deployment

The application consists of two pices: the Bot and the backend.

the Bot interacts with rocket.chat instance while the backend interacts with the batfish.

And finally the Bot sends requests to backend via GET/POST http requests.

### 1. Deploing Bot 

Bot is a nodejs application. It uses rocket.chat SDK and a node-fetch module. To run Bot first you have to install that modules under the Bot directory.

```
cd bot
npm init -y
npm install @rocket.chat/sdk
npm install node-fetch --save
```
next open up *easybot.js* file in editor and change chatbots url and credentials

now you can run bot just typing:
```
node easybot.js
```

### 2. Deploing Backend

Backend is a python application that uses the FastAPI framework and the pybatfish library. 
Note: pybatfish comes with pandas (Data analysisi library) version 0.26.x, but the application uses the function .to_markdown() that appeared since version 1.0.0. So packages must be installed in order: first install pybatfish, next - pandas.

```
pip3 install pybatfish
pip3 install --upgrade pandas
```
and install fastAPI as well:
```
pip3 install fastapi
pip3 install uvicorn
```
now run batfish in a docker container:
```
docker run --name batfish -v batfish-data:/data -p 8888:8888 -p 9997:9997 -p 9996:9996 batfish/allinone
```

It's time to make sure batfish is working.   
To do that you have to prepare network configuration files and place them under the directory
> backend/bf_snapshots/networks/configs

then run interactive python (ipython or bpython) and excute the following code:
```
import pandas as pd
from pybatfish.client.commands import *
from pybatfish.datamodel import *
from pybatfish.datamodel.answer import *
from pybatfish.datamodel.flow import *
from pybatfish.question import *
from pybatfish.question import bfq
load_questions()
bf_session.host = 'localhost'
bf_set_network('bf1')
bf_init_snapshot('./bf_snapshots/networks', 'snapshot-01', overwrite=True)
```
batfish should find the configs and then a snapshot should be created. If all went well you can exit the interactive python shell and finally run the application by typing the command:
> uvicorm main:app 

Actually you don't have to init snapshot manually every time the network configs has been changed.
There is the special command to do that from within the application. 
**@botname acl help** - command will help you to reveal it


## Docker

Now I'll try to dockerise the service to be more convinient to use

There will be three docker containers:  
  1. batfish
  2. backend
  3. bot

### 1. batfish container
Batfish is being delivered as a docker container from the very beginig.  
The only change we need is to add ***-d*** parameter to the run command:
> docker run --name batfish -v batfish-data:/data -p 8888:8888 -p 9997:9997 -p 9996:9996 -d batfish/allinone

### 2. backend container

DockerFile is built based on a [FastAPI tutorial: Deployment#Docker](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/#docker)

To make a a container we have to run the following command:
> sudo docker build -t netbot.backend -f ./backend.docker .

And then run the container:
> sudo docker run -d -p 8000:80 --name netbot -v ~/configs:/app/bf_snapshots/networks/bf1/configs --link batfish -e BF_HOSTNAME=batfish netbot.backend

Take a look at options -v, -e and --link

For a docker version the network configs folder has been brought out ouside of the container
To bring configs back to the container option ***-v*** (or --volume) is being used

***-e*** and ***--link*** options point out to the batfish container  
both parameters must contain tbe same value*

### 3. bot container

to be implemented
